# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
H-H
 /  \
H-H  H-H
 \  /
  H-H
TYPE: ZIGZAG
PEAKS: 3
COLOR: BLUE

## What I Think This Means
The patterns show the structure is bent, not straight.

## What This Could Be
could be a playground frame

## Questions I Have
Why it has to be H-H and 3 peaks?
